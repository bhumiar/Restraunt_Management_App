# 🍽️ Restaurant Management System

A web-based Restaurant Management System where users can **view menus**, **place orders**, and **book tables** online.  
We also addressed the issue of *ghost reservations* by implementing a **time-based booking confirmation logic** — bookings not confirmed within a set time are auto-cancelled.
